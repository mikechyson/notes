\chapter*{Dedication}
I benifit a lot from Goodfellow's ``DEEP LEARNING''. The book explain machine learning and deep learning on theory deeply.

``deep learning for computer vision with python starter'', ``deep learning for computer vision with python practitioner'' and ``deep learning for computer vision with python imagenet'' explain computer vision by practice. You can learn machine learning and deep learning by practicing.

``Case Studies'' is about the basis of the OpenCV, and can be used as the introduction to OpenCV.



Having read several books on machine learning and deep learning, I decide to write down some important concepts and my interpretation on them.
You may find that it is difficult to understand some sentences, because I cite them from the book ``DEEP LEARNING''.
It is recommend to read the book ``DEEP LEARNING'' yourself if you find these sentences difficult to understand.
