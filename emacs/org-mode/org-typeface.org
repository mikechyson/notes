Org-mode develops organizational tasks around a NOTES file 
which contains information about projects as plain text.  

Org-mode is implemented on top of outline-mode.  

It supports ToDo items, deadlines and time stamps.
Plain text URL-like links connect to websites, emails (VM), Usenet messages (Gnus), BBDB entries, and any files related to the project.
For printing and sharing of notes, an Org-mode file (or a part of it) can be exported as a structured ASCII or HTML file.

The following commands are available:




+----------+-------------------+------------------------+
|C-c %     |org-mark-ring-push |like "pushd" in linux   |
+----------+-------------------+------------------------+
|C-c &     |org-mark-ring-goto |like "popd" in linux    |
