The specially formatted string carrying the date and/or time information is called a timestamp in Org mode.
* Timestamps
** Plain timestamp
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
<2016-11-01 Wed 19:15>

#+END_EXAMPLE

** Timestamp with repeater interval
It applies not only on the given date, but again and again after a certain interval of
N days(d), weeks(w), months(m), or years(y).
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
<2007-05-16 Wed 12:30 +1w>

| org-display-custom-times      |
| org-time-stamp-custom-formats |

| Key Bound   | Functions                      | Description                                               |

| C-c C-x C-t | org-toggle-time-stamp-overlays | Toggle the display of custom formats for dates and times. |




* Deadlines and scheduling
A timestamp may be preceded by special keywords to facilitate planning.
Both the timestamp and the keyword have to be positioned immediately after the task they refer to.

** DEADLINE
Meaning: the task is supposed to be finished on that date.

In addition, the agenda for today will carry a warning about
the approaching or missed deadline, starting =org-deadline-warning-days=
before the due date, and continuing until the entry is marked DONE.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
          *** TODO write article about the Earth for the Guide
              DEADLINE: <2004-02-29 Sun>
#+END_EXAMPLE

** SCHEDULED
Meaning: you are planning to start working on that task on the given date.


#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
          *** TODO Call Trillian for a date on New Years Eve.
              SCHEDULED: <2004-12-25 Sat>
#+END_EXAMPLE

=org-scheduled-delay-days=
=org-agenda-skip-scheduled-delay-if-deadline=


** Inserting deadline/schedule

| Key Bounding | Function            | Description                                       | Prefix                                                 | Config                                                                                    |
|--------------+---------------------+---------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| C-c C-d      | org-deadline        | Insert DEADLINE keyword along with a stamp.       | An existing deadline will be removed from the entry.   | org-deadline-warning-days, org-log-redeadline                                             |
| C-c C-s      | org-schedule        | Insert SCHEDULED keyword along with a stamp.      | An existing scheduling will be removed from the entry. | org-scheduled-delay-days, org-agenda-skip-scheduled-delay-if-deadline, org-log-reschedule |



** Repeated tasks
| Variable       | Description                                                  |
|----------------+--------------------------------------------------------------|
| org-log-repeat | record moving through the DONE state when triggering repeat. |
|                |                                                              |

If you need both a repeater and a special warning period, 
the repeater should come first and the warning period last:
<2005-10-01 Sat +1m -3d>

| Symbol | Description                    |
|--------+--------------------------------|
| +      | shift a exact time repeater    |
| -      | delay                          |
| ++     | shift at least a time repeater |
| .+     | shift to next time repeater    |


#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     ** TODO Call Father
        DEADLINE: <2008-02-10 Sun ++1w>
        Marking this DONE will shift the date by at least one week,
        but also by as many weeks as it takes to get this date into
        the future.  However, it stays on a Sunday, even if you called
        and marked it done on Saturday.
     ** TODO Empty kitchen trash
        DEADLINE: <2008-02-08 Fri 20:00 ++1d>
        Marking this DONE will shift the date by at least one day, and
        also by as many days as it takes to get the timestamp into the
        future.  Since there is a time in the timestamp, the next
        deadline in the future will be on today's date if you
        complete the task before 20:00.
     ** TODO Check the batteries in the smoke detectors
        DEADLINE: <2005-11-01 Tue .+1m>
        Marking this DONE will shift the date to one month after
        today.
