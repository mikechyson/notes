This weekend, I learn a complete example of tikz. In order to draw output the desired diagram, I learn some much knowledge (shape: line, circle, ractangle, node, ...; property: dashed, red, shadow, thick, thin, radius, ...;). I find that it is tedious to draw a diagram. This make me depressed. There is a moment that I think learning it is a wast of time and I want to quit.

Later, I rethink it. I review my learning of Emacs. It takes me 2 monthes before I can use it commonly. But after mastering Emacs, it does benefit me in making notes. The most importance is the idea during my learning of Emacs.
1. Time spent in developing a good habbit is time well spent.
2. It's possible to absorb a lot from one reading, but you can form only a few new habit each day. Don't feel obliged to learn them all at once.
3. You can not learning something without using it.



Before you do something, think if it is necessary to do that. List the approves and disapproves. If it is necessary, just do it.


If you feel bored, think the scense after you have grasped it.
