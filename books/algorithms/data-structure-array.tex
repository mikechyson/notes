\section{What is an array?}

An Array is a collection of items.
The items are stored in neighboring (contiguous) memory locations.


For example:
\begin{tikzpicture}[>=latex]
\matrix[mymat,anchor=west,row 2/.style={nodes=draw}]
at (0,0) 
(mat1)
{
  \\
2 & 1 & 3 & 2 & 1 \\
};
\end{tikzpicture}

\section{Capacity and length}

The capacity is the items it can hold at most.
It is specified when you create an array.

Length is the number of items it holds currently.


\section{Operations}

Array is a data structure, which means that it stores data in a specific format and supports certain operations on the data it stores.


There are three basic operations in array:
\begin{itemize}
\item insert
\item delete
\item search
\end{itemize}
