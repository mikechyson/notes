\chapter{Virtual host}

Sometimes, you want to run several website on one server with only one ip.
In this situation, you can use name-based virtual host.


\section{Virtual host}

To make the configuration clear, I create a two virtual hosts configuration \verb|chyson.net.conf| and \verb|chyson.fun.conf| separately.
Here is my directory structure:
\begin{verbatim}
[root@chyson conf.d]# pwd
/etc/httpd/conf.d
[root@chyson conf.d]# ls
README          chyson.fun.conf  django.conf  userdir.conf
autoindex.conf  chyson.net.conf  ssl.conf     welcome.conf
\end{verbatim}
