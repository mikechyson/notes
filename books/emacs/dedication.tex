\chapter{Dedication}
The first text editor I systematically learn is actually \keyword{vim}.
As the default text editor on Linux, I use it to write shell script and edit configuration files on Linux OS.
Once, I saw the debate between Emacs and Vim on Internet.
At that time, I had never used Emacs, so I couldn't say which one is more suitable to me.
I learned Emacs at all my spare time and was facinated by the functionality and power of it.
I dicide to use Emacs as my main text editor expecially having read ``Hacker and Painter''.


The book I write here is with Emacs's  \LaTeX mode (AUCTex acutally).
