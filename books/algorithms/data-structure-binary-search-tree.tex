A binary search tree (BST), a special form of a binary tree, satisfies the binary search property:

\begin{itemize}
\item The value in each node must be greater than (or equal to) any values stored in its left subtree.
\item The value in each node must be less than (or equal to) any values stored in its right subtree.
\end{itemize}




The strength of a BST is that you can perform all search, insertion and deletion operations in $O(h)$ time complexity even in the worst case.



Usually, if you want to store data in order and need several operations, such as search, insertion or deletion, at the same time, a BST might be a good choice.
