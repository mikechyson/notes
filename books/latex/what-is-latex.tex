\section{What is \LaTeX}
\LaTeX is a document markup language.


\section{\LaTeX's Properties}


\begin{enumerate}
\item \LaTeX is portable in three ways:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item The source code is open.
  \item The implementation is in plain text.
  \item The output is in multiple format: PDF, DVI, PostScript, HTML.
  \end{enumerate}
\item Protect your work:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item compatibility (plain text)
  \item no viruses (plain text)
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}


\section{Reason to Use It}
Becuase \LaTeX is a markup language, you should learn it before you can use it.
So why should you spend so much time to learn it while there is so much document creator like Word, Pages?

There is several reasons that push me to select it:
\begin{description}
  \item[powerful:] \LaTeX provides powerful edit ability. You can almost get whatever you want to show, especially the mathematical equations. Other document editor is less powerful in equations editing.
  \item[easy to alter:] Because \LaTeX seperate the format and the content, it is easy to do format alteration in the full document domain, for example change the style of the capter.
  \item[one for all:] Once you create your own template, it is easy to wreate document with the template applied, saving so much time in format. The disadvantage is that you spend more time in the first time.
