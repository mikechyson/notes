Al Khwarizmi laid out basic method ofr adding, multiplying, and dividing numbers.
This procedures were precise, unambiguous, mechanical, efficient, correct - in short, they were algorithms.


Fibonacci
\begin{equation}
F_n = 
\begin{cases}
F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} & \quad if \quad n > 1 \\
1 & \quad if \quad n=1 \\ 
0 & \quad if \quad n=0
\end{cases}
\end{equation}


Moore's law:
Computer speeds have been doubling roughly every 18 months.
